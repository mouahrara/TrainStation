The Train Station (Iterum) mod is a rework of the [Train Station](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6183) mod (by [CherryChain](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/3590100)) relying on the [Transport Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/29911) mod. It allows mod authors to add additional train stations to create a railway transport network.
